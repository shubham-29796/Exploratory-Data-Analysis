# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Performing an EDA on Uber data-set to understand the why is Uber losing out on money due to non-availability and cancellation of rides.

We have uber masked data with us which is used by the company to resolve their business problem. We have data regarding rides to and from the airport as our main objective is to find problems pertaining to airport specific rides.

I first cleaned the data and corrected the two different date formats and took out date and hour from it.

I derived new metrics by divding the hours into different parts of the day.

I dervied a new column named Demand-supply gap and then visualised the data to draw insights from it.

I created crosstabs and countplots to understand where and when the problem of non-availablity and cancellation of rides are prominent.

I drew conclusions from it and suggested measures to combat those challenges.
